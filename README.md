Our goal is to get the data of 100 best K-beauty items in Olive Young, the largest beauty select store platform in South Korea, and then search the price of each item from one of the largest beauty select store platform in the United States. Our team picked Soko Glam for the data.
1. Execute the olive_young.py to get the data of 100 best K-beauty items in Korea by web scraping. It would make products.csv
2. Execute the soko_glam.py to get the price of the each of 100 best K-beauty items in U.S. by web scraping. This would make soko_glam_csv.py
3. Execute the data_analysis.py for further data analysis, finding out the price differences of each item, and the trends of each market.
